This folder will hold any practical code written for the SOT-Ruby101 lecture

Ruby -

Object Orientated,
No type checking e.g 0 = '0'

Everything is an object, even numbers. This means methods apply to everything
using the dot syntax

cmds:
irb creates a 'node-type' enviroment in the terminal.

.rb creates ruby file

methods:

puts = console.log

no need to declare objects
